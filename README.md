# Kenielf's Arch Linux Open Setup
This is a repo of scripts, guides and notes to install arch Linux and is intended for personal use. Some of it may be useful to you, in which case feel free to use it.

## Contributing
As this is intended for personal use, contributions should apply as such:

### Code
Create an issue and describe what you believe should be changed, if possible also explain how it could be changed and possibly create a pull request after authorization.

### Guides and Notes
Typos can be directly fixed as pull requests, no questions asked. Changes must be suggested first, and if permitted, created through a pull request.

## Files
 - [Base Installation](base-install.md)
 - [Extended Installation](extended-install.md)
